## 🏗️ Architecture

The project is built on a microservices architecture and includes:

### Backend (ASP.NET Core 10)
- **Domain Layer** - Rich domain models with business logic, entities, value objects, domain events
- **Application Layer** - Implements use cases using CQRS pattern, domain event handlers and result pattern
- **Infrastructure Layer** - External services (JWT, Email, password hashing)
- **Persistence Layer** - Database interaction (ORM - Entity Framework Core) with repository pattern
- **WebAPI Layer** - REST API controllers, DTOs and middleware

### Frontend (Next.js 16)
- Using Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) methodology with clear separation of concerns
- Primary user-facing interface for music streaming and management
- User authorization with JWT tokens

### Moderation App (React + Vite)
- Administrative interface for content moderation and system management
- Using Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) methodology with clear separation of concerns
- Permissions-based access control with JWT tokens

### File Service (Go)
- Independent HTTP microservice for S3 interactions
- Integration with MinIO (S3-compatible storage)
- Using distributed cache based on Redis for better performance on getting files

### Infrastructure
- **PostgreSQL** - Main database for primary data
- **Redis** - Storage for tokens and distributed cache
- **MinIO** - Object storage for audio and image files
- **Nginx** - Reverse proxy and load balancer
- **MailHog** - Test SMTP server for development
- **Prometheus** - Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana** - Metrics visualization and dashboards

## ✨ Main Features

- **User Accounts Management** - view information and statistics about users, manage user accounts or songs published by users
- **Moderator Accounts Management** - view and manage moderator accounts, give or revoke permissions if you are super-moderator
- **Bulk Operations** - publish or delete multiple songs at once
- **Audio Preview** - listen to songs before moderation decisions

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability
- **Real-time Metrics** - track application performance and health
- **Custom Dashboards** - visualize key metrics in Grafana
- **System Monitoring** - monitor server resources and infrastructure
- **HTTP Metrics** - request rates, response times, error rates
- **Database Metrics** - query performance and connection pools

## 🛠️ Installation and Launch

### Requirements
- Docker and Docker Compose
- .NET 10 SDK (for local development)
- Node.js 18+ (for local development)

### ⚙️ Configuration

The application requires the following environment variables to be configured:

#### Database
- `POSTGRES_USER` - PostgreSQL user
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - PostgreSQL password
- `POSTGRES_DB` - database name

#### Redis
- `REDIS_PASSWORD` - Redis password
- `REDIS_USER` - Redis user

#### MinIO
- `MINIO_ROOT_USER` - MinIO user
- `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` - MinIO password

#### Grafana 
- `GRAFANA_USER` - Grafana user
- `GRAFANA_PASSWORD` - Grafana password

#### JWT
- `JwtOptions__SecretKey` - JWT token secret key
- `JwtOptions__ExpiresHours` - token ttl

#### Email (SMTP)
- `SmtpOptions__Server` - SMTP server domain
- `SmtpOptions__Port` - SMTP server port

#### Next SSR endpoints
- `SERVER_API_URL` - endpoint for web api (if running in container use host.docker.internal)
- `FILE_SERVER_URL` - endpoint for file service (if running in container use host.docker.internal)
*endpoints for client side request are hardcoded because of the way how next.js operates with env variables*

### 📝 Important Notes

- All configuration settings must be specified in .env files
- For production, it is recommended to use external services instead of MailHog
- MinIO is used for file storage, make sure access is configured correctly
- Initial moderator credentials: *admin@admin.com adminadmin*
