## Description

As a beginner developer, I'm excited to present my Spotify clone web application, a simple platform for streaming music online. Built using Next.js and .NET Core, this application offers a user-friendly interface and essential features for music lovers, including the ability to upload and share their own content. This application provides a foundation for building a comprehensive music streaming platform.

### Key Features:

- **User Uploads**: Upload your own music tracks and share them with the community.
- **Search and Filtering**: Find specific songs, and user-uploaded content using search and filtering options.
- **Playlists**: Organize your favorite tracks into personalized playlists. 

### Project development plans:

- [ ] Creation of a service for moderation of published songs.
- [ ] Creation of a service for account confirmation.

### Remarks

The application requires parameters that are not specified in the code and must be obtained from .env files.
The *pg_trgm* and *btree_gin* extensions must be installed in the database and EF Core migration must be performed.
